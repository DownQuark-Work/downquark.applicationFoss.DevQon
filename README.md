TODO:
- https://tauri.app/v1/guides/features/
  - implement the CLI??
  - use the native system tray

## system tray
  - https://tauri.app/v1/guides/features/system-tray

The first implementation will be created simultaneously with the [Qanban Board](//github.com/DownQuark-Work/downquark.applicationFoss.QanbanBoard).

This will ensure that all customizable aspects required to make the Development Qonsole a success will be working correctly.

This may be helpful when it is time to implement the board:

## Creating additional HTML pages
- https://tauri.app/v1/guides/features/multiwindow
If you want to create additional pages beyond index.html, you will need to make sure they are present in the dist directory at build time. How you do this depends on your frontend setup.
