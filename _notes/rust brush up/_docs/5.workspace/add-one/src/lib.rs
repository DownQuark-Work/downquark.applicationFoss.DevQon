/*
  The top-level Cargo.lock now contains information about the dependency of add-one on rand.
  However, even though rand is used somewhere in the workspace, 
    we canâ€™t use it in other crates in the workspace unless we add rand to their Cargo.toml files as well. 
  For example, if we add use rand; to the adder/src/main.rs file for the adder crate, weâ€™ll get an error:
*/
use rand;

/// Adds one to the number given.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// let arg = 5;
/// let answer = add_one::add_one(arg);
///
/// assert_eq!(6, answer);
/// ```
pub fn add_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x + 1
}
