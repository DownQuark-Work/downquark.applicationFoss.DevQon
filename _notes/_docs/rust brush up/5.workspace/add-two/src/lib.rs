/*
  The top-level Cargo.lock now contains information about the dependency of add-two on rand.
  However, even though rand is used somewhere in the workspace, 
    we canâ€™t use it in other crates in the workspace unless we add rand to their Cargo.toml files as well. 
  For example, if we add use rand; to the adder/src/main.rs file for the adder crate, weâ€™ll get an error:
*/
use rand;

/// Adds two to the number given.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// let arg = 5;
/// let answer = add_two::add_two(arg);
///
/// assert_eq!(7, answer);
/// ```
pub fn add_two(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x + 2
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn it_works() {
        assert_eq!(4, add_two(2));
    }
}
